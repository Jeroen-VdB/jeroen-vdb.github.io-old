### Hi there!

In my first post, I’d like to quickly introduce myself.  

I’ve been working for Realdolmen as an Integration Consultant for almost 2 years.  
Now that I’m starting to acquire some work experience, I’m starting a blog to share all my struggles and tips with the world.

Besides work, I like to keep myself busy learning more about software engineering in general.  
And when I want to take a break from sitting behind the monitor all day, I get behind my drum kit or go for a hike.

That said, I hope I can help out my fellow developers in my future posts.  
See you in the next one! 😁
